        <div>
            <p> This is data about my projects and my projects are about me;
                so, meta data about me.</p>

            <p>I cannot say if the projects have defined my interests or if the
                interests have lead me to the projects, in truth it is a bit
                of both.  All of my comments about myself will therefore be expressed
                in the context (contest) of the projects that comprise my life's
                work.</p>

            dieCAS was the first place where I was able
            to implement collaborative engineering techniques.
            The technique was fairly primitive, using Sun's ONC/RPC and a central server.
            It did use speculative locking, rather than preemptive locking.
            The motivation was due to the participants being distributed geographically.
            Most other collabortive engineering was performed in close proximity so preemptive locking was practical.

            <p>
                I had the opportunity to develop a parametric modeller for die design.
                I also created parametric models for pistons.

            <p>
                The Transformative Applications (DARPA) project was an effort to
                reduce the cost of military communcations equipment by using
                commodity smart phones.
