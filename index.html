            <p> This is data about my projects and my projects are about me;
                so, meta data about me.</p>

            <p>I cannot say if the projects have defined my interests or if the
                interests have lead me to the projects, in truth it is a bit
                of both.  All of my comments about myself will therefore be expressed
                in the context (contest) of the projects that comprise my life's
                work.</p>

            <p>Discovering the neural code</p>
            <p>
                The main objective for these techniques was to
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_coding">discover the neural code</a>.
                There were a number of interesting results from this work.
                We obtained data from Dr. Steve Potter at Georgia Tech.
                This data was obtained from a multi-electrode array
                monitoring embrionic rat brains.
                The spike trains were prospected for episodes.
                These episodes are believed to indicate the presence of circuits.
            </p>

            <p>
                One assumption is that all neural spikes are the same.
            <a href="data-prospecting/spike-waveforms.png">embrionic rat brain neural waveforms</a>
                This is clearly not the case.
            </p>
            <p>
                An indicator that we had actually discovered circuits would
                be that the shapes of the waveforms that make up these circuits
                should be visibly similar.
                The research showed that circuits can be discovered in this
                way and that the spike patterns match.

                I was supprised by the conformance of these waveforms.

            <p>Collaborative engineering – die casting tooling</p>
            <p>
                dieCAS was the first place where I was able
                to implement collaborative engineering techniques.
                The technique was fairly primitive, using Sun's ONC/RPC and a central server.
                It did use speculative locking, rather than preemptive locking.
                The motivation was due to the participants being distributed geographically.
                Most other collabortive engineering was performed in close proximity so preemptive locking was practical.

            <p>
                I had the opportunity to develop a parametric modeller for die design.
                I also created parametric models for pistons.

            <p>
                The Transformative Applications (DARPA) project was an effort to
                reduce the cost of military communcations equipment by using
                commodity smart phones.

                Based on the work done with dieCAS, the value of distributed
                control became obvious.  We started a company that developed
                these techniques which were used to provide computer network
                management to clients.  The application of these techniques
                was demonstrated and the company was sold in 2008.
