        <h1>
GM To Commercialize DieCAS Software Technology Through Technalysis, Inc. In Move To Further Reduce Costs And Improve Quality Of Castings By Suppliers
        </h1>

        <div>
            <p>
Warren, Mich. - General Motors announced it will commercialize its dieCAS computer
                software that analyzes die casting processes at least 10 times
                faster than similar commercial applications.
                GM has granted a license to Technalysis, Inc. for exclusive rights to develop,
                market and support a commercial version of its dieCAS software. Terms were not disclosed.
            </p>

            <p>
Developed by GM Research and Development with
                assistance from EDS, dieCAS (for die Casting Analysis System),
                is a workstation-based CAE (Computer Aided Engineering) product
                that has saved GM more than $8 million annually.
                Since 1990, it has been used to reduce scrap and improve
                productivity in GM Powertrain's die casting operations
                for transmission cases and engine blocks.
            </p>

            <p>
"By commercializing dieCAS,
                we will provide improvements in the cost and quality of castings,
                including non-powertrain applications, that are purchased from our suppliers,"
                explained Gary McDonald, director of the Enterprise Systems Lab
                at the GM Research and Development Center.
                "Furthermore, under the agreement, GM can continue to use dieCAS
                for its own casting operations at a reduced cost
                by spreading the costs of software maintenance over a wider number of users."
            </p>

            <p>
According to McDonald,
                GM selected the Indianapolis-based Technalysis because
                it was an established company with experience in
                manufacturing analysis software,
                engineering analysis services and specialty casting.
            </p>

            <p>
"As an engineering consulting and software development
                company for over 15 years,
                our business has been to provide packaged and customized CAE software,
                software consulting, and engineering consulting in fluid mechanics,
                heat transfer, and materials for product/process modeling and design,"
                said Akin Ecer, president of Technalysis.
                "We're very excited about our association with GM and
                the future prospects for commercial dieCAS application."
            </p>

            <p>
dieCAS goes well beyond the scope of traditional casting analysis
                to address a wide variety of product and process problems,
                many of which are unique to die casting, according to Alan Steffe,
                manufacturing engineering director for castings at GM Powertrain.
                "Unlike other general purpose casting analysis products,
                dieCAS is specialized to die casting," said Steffe.
            </p>

            <p>
"As a result,
                it takes advantage of die casting's unique characteristics
                and achieves enormous savings in analysis time,
                without sacrificing solution accuracy."
                Steffe added that dieCAS has shortened process development
                time up to one year for large powertrain castings
                by eliminating trial and error with physical hardware.
            </p>

            <p>
The scope of the dieCAS analysis
                includes heat transfer and solidification,
                liquid metal flow, and casting and die distortion.
                The combination of analysis speed and
                ease of use make dieCAS ideally suited to a design environment,
                where many different process alternatives must be
                investigated in a short period of time.
                Nearly all results are available in about an hour, even on very large dies.
            </p>

            <p>
dieCAS is the only CAE product
                to offer analysis of the entire die and machine,
                including the nonlinear contact problem at the uneven
                parting surfaces between die components, GM R&D's McDonald said.
                He added that dieCAS's broad spectrum of analysis
                provides valuable insight into the causes and potential
                remedies for a wide variety of common die casting problems.
            </p>

            <p>
GM's increased usage of math models,
                such as dieCAS, is helping the company to cut costs and
                shorten product development times by allowing validation simulations and
                reducing reliance on physical hardware for testing and evaluation.
                As a result, GM currently has three vehicle programs in
                an 18-month development cycle and another 25 vehicle programs
                in a 24-month development cycle, down from 33 months three years ago.
                The company so far has saved $1 billion in development costs.
