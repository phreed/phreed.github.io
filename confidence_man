## Confidence Man

People can be divided up in different ways.
One way is based on trust.

* You can be in on the con.
* Be a victim of the con.
* Avoid the con.

The primary sign of a confidence man is for you to trust him without evidence.
* "Trust me"
* "Belive me"

The primary sign of someone you can trust is their "wonk"iness.
* "Let me show you"
* "This is why it must be true"
